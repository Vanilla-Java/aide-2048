Welcome to the 2048 Sliding Block Puzzle project! This repository contains a Java-based version of the popular 2048 game—enhanced with support for rectangular boards, dynamic tile spawn probabilities, and single-step undo. The game uses a classic Model–View–Controller (MVC) pattern and can run with either a Swing-based GUI or console-based view.

This was created as an exercise in AI assisted development (AIDE) to demonstrate how AI can help developers write better code and documentation. The project is structured to show how to organise code and documentation side by side.

== 1. Overview

This project illustrates how to build and maintain a 2048 puzzle with flexible dimensions (`NxM`), a dynamic win tile, and probability-based tile spawning. It also demonstrates best practices for organising AsciiDoc documentation alongside code. The repository includes:

* **Java Source Code** in `src/main/java/town/lost/g2k/...`
* **Tests** in `src/test/java/town/lost/g2k/...`
* **AsciiDoc Documentation** in both `src/main/adoc/` (for game specs) and `aide/` (for AI/workflow/style guidance)
* **Maven Project Files** (`pom.xml`, etc.)
* **License Summaries**

=== Key Features
1. **Rectangular Boards**  
   Supports 3×3, 4×4, 5×7, 6×9, etc. (not just NxN).
2. **Dynamic Win Condition**  
   Tile thresholds (e.g., 2048 for 4×4, 8192 for 5×5) set via a switch statement in `Main.java`.
3. **Custom Spawn Probabilities**  
   By default: 2 = 80%, 4 = 15%, 8 = 4%, 16 = 1%.
4. **Undo Support**  
   Single-step undo by pressing **U** or clicking Undo in the GUI (if enabled in `GameConfig`).
5. **MVC Architecture**  
   Clean separation between `GameBoard` (Model), `GameController` (Controller), and `SwingGameView`/`ConsoleGameView` (View).

== 2. How to Build and Run

=== Prerequisites
* Java 11 or higher (set in `pom.xml`)
* Maven 3.x or higher

=== Building from Source
1. **Clone or Download** this repository to your local machine.
2. **Open a Terminal** (or command prompt) in the project root folder.
3. **Compile** and **Test**:

   mvn clean install

This command runs all unit tests in `src/test/java`.

=== Running the Game
After building, you can run the Swing-based 2048 puzzle in several ways:

==== 1) Using Maven Exec

[source,bash]
----
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=town.lost.g2k.Main
----

==== 2) Using the Packaged JAR
1. Package the project:

   mvn clean package

2. Find the JAR in `target/g2k-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar` (version may vary).
3. Run:

   java -jar target/g2k-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar


When launched, the **Swing Dialog** will prompt for an `NxM` dimension (e.g., `3x3`, `4x4`, `5x7`, etc.). If you close or cancel the dialog, the game defaults to `4x4`.

== 3. How to Play

=== Objective
Combine numbered tiles by sliding them around the board until you reach or exceed the “win tile” (for instance, 2048 on a 4×4 board).

=== Controls

* **Arrow Keys** (↑, ↓, ←, →) – Move tiles
* **WASD** – Alternate keys for Up/Down/Left/Right
* **U** – Undo (revert one move), if enabled
* **Undo Button (GUI)** – Same effect as pressing **U**

When two tiles with the same number collide, they merge into one tile whose value is the sum of both. Each merge adds to your **Score** (e.g., merging two 4s = +8 points).

=== Gameplay Flow
1. **Choose Board Size**  
   Select an `NxM` dimension (e.g., `4x4`) from the popup.  
2. **Move Tiles**  
   Press arrow keys/WASD. Tiles slide as far as possible in that direction and merge if identical.
3. **Spawn New Tile**  
   After a valid move, a new tile (2, 4, 8, or 16) appears, following the probabilities in the code.  
4. **Win Condition**  
   If you create a tile >= your board’s `winTileValue`, you “WIN.”  
5. **Lose Condition**  
   If the board is full and no merges are possible, the game ends.  

=== Undo Feature
* **Press 'U'** or click the **Undo** button to revert the board and score to the previous state.  
* Only the **most recent** move can be undone if `undoEnabled` is `true` in `GameConfig`.

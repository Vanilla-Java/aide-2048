== 1. Introduction

Beyond the **baseline** NxN puzzle, single-step undo, and per-size local high scores, this document describes optional features that can further enrich the 2048 experience.

== 2. Larger Boards (8x8 and Beyond)

1. **Goal**: Support boards bigger than 6×6 (like 8×8, 10×10).
2. **Implementation**:
- Expand the UI’s dimension prompt or menu.
- Test merges for performance on bigger boards.
3. **Risks**: Move times or merges might slow.
4. **Testing**: Fill large boards, confirm no merges => lost condition.

== 3. Multiple Undos

1. **Overview**: Instead of single-step, store a stack of prior states.
2. **UI**: Possibly show how many undos are left.
3. **Memory**: Each snapshot is an NxN array, so big boards cost more memory.
4. **Testing**: Repeated undo calls across multiple merges.

== 4. Online Leaderboard

1. **Idea**: Compare scores across machines via a web service.
2. **Data**: Must store username, dimension, final score.
3. **Security**: Avoid cheating or tampering. Possibly https or tokens.
4. **UI**: Add a “Show Leaderboard” or “Submit Score” flow.

== 5. Advanced Animations

1. **Animations**: Smooth tile sliding, merging “pop” effect.
2. **Implementation**: A game loop or a Swing Timer with `TileAnimation` objects.
3. **Performance**: For bigger boards or slow machines, allow disabling animations.

== 6. Additional Feature Ideas

- **Custom Themes**: Different color sets or tile designs.
- **Timed Mode**: Limit the user’s total time or time per move.
- **Event Tiles**: Rare tile spawns with special behavior (like doubling).

== 7. Testing & Risk Analysis

|===
|Enhancement|Risk|Mitigation
|Large boards|Performance slowdown|Test with 8×8 or larger. Possibly limit size or optimize merges.
|Multiple Undos|Increased complexity, memory usage|Limit max undos, thoroughly test repeated merges/spawns.
|Online Leaderboard|Network errors, security concerns|Handle offline gracefully, use encryption or tokens if storing user data.
|Animations|Frame rate drops in large boards|Allow disabling. Use a 60fps limit or skip frames.

== 8. Conclusion

These enhancements can be adopted incrementally to expand the 2048 puzzle’s appeal and replay value. Each feature adds complexity but yields richer gameplay. Refer to **`overall.adoc`** for a top-level overview, or **`detailed.adoc`** for the baseline specification.

== 1. Introduction

This AsciiDoc provides a deeper look at how the 2048 puzzle is implemented, including **rectangular boards**, **dynamic spawn probabilities**, **single-step undo**, and now **sliding animations**.

== 2. Functional Requirements

=== 2.1 Board Size Selection
- On startup, the user is prompted for an NxM dimension (via Swing dialog or console input).
- Defaults to 4x4 if cancelled.

=== 2.2 Dynamic Win Tile
- A `switch` statement in `Main` sets `winTileValue` based on the chosen NxM.
- The game is won when a tile >= `winTileValue` appears.

=== 2.3 Tile Spawn Probabilities
- Defaults: 2=80%, 4=15%, 8=4%, 16=1%.
- Configurable in `GameConfig` for custom spawn logic.

=== 2.4 Undo Feature
- Single-step undo (press 'U' or click "Undo"), if `undoEnabled=true`.

=== 2.5 Sliding Animations (New in v3.1)
1. **Overview**
After each move, the game shows a short (~300ms) animation where tiles slide from their old positions to their new positions.
2. **Naive Matching**
By default, the code compares the *before* and *after* board states by tile value and location, generating `TileMovement` records.
- **Caveat**: Identical-value merges can cause confusion.
- For a robust merge animation, add unique IDs to each tile in the model.
3. **Implementation Highlights**
- **GameController** captures the board before calling `model.move()`, then compares it with the final state to produce a list of `TileMovement`.
- **SwingGameView** runs these movements in `showAnimations(...)` with a `Timer(300ms)` before rendering the final board state.

== 3. Board Initialization and Reset

=== 3.1 NxM Board Array
- `GameBoard` uses a 2D array `[ySize][xSize]`.
- Two tiles appear at random empty cells upon reset.

=== 3.2 Undo Snapshot
- If undo is enabled, each valid move stores a snapshot of the board + score.

== 4. MVC Architecture

- **Model (GameBoard)**: Holds the 2D array, merges tiles, spawns new tiles, tracks score and status.
- **Controller (GameController)**:
- Coordinates user moves, calls `model.move(direction)`, triggers undo, checks game status.
- Gathers `TileMovement` data for sliding animations.
- **View (SwingGameView)**:
- Displays the grid via `JLabel`s, captures user input (arrow/WASD), and animates tile slides.

== 5. Additional Enhancements

=== 5.1 Larger Boards
E.g., 6×9 or 8×8. Confirm performance for big grids.

=== 5.2 Multiple Undos
Store a stack of previous states, at the cost of memory usage.

=== 5.3 Online Leaderboard
Optionally post final scores to a remote server.

== 6. Testing
- Verify dimension parsing (3x4, 4x4, 5x7).
- Check merges and new tile spawns at correct probabilities.
- Confirm sliding animations appear for each move.
- Undo reverts the board to pre-move.

== 7. Conclusion
The puzzle now offers a more dynamic experience with **sliding animations**, rectangular boards, and flexible spawn rules. For more advanced merges or multi-step animations, consider tile IDs and incremental drawing. The design remains modular, following the MVC pattern, ensuring future extensions and enhancements are straightforward.
